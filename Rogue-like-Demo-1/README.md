#### This is the directory for rogue-like-demo-1.

This is a Demo from Unity2D tutorial: Ruby’s Adventure.
This Demo is very similar in mechanism to the game we designed, a 2D adventure game, but the game we designed will add more rouge-like elements, and the combat mechanism will be more diverse and complex.
Here is the demo built in Unity.(Note:The scene is created by ourselves）
The scene includes protagonists, enemies, NPCs, obstacles, treasure chests, etc., as well as some simple collision detection.
